# AEQ

This code supports preprocessing and analysing data acquired from the ASMR-Experience Questionnaire (AEQ) developed at Goldsmiths University. The AEQ is a new web-based psychometric tool to assess how participants respond to autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) stimuli that uses a data-driven approach (k-means). The measure sought to:
1)	produce diagnostic groupings (e.g. ASMR-Responder, non-Responder), which reflect individual differences inherent in the data rather than being set by the experimenter. 
2)	identify sub-groupings in the population to facilitate False-Positive identification, as well as sub-groupings present in ASMR-Responder and non-Responder populations. 
3)	capture ASMR state through immediate retrospective ASMR-related measures.

**Code summary:**

R code to determine number of clusters that is optimal for k-means using a variety of approaches (e..g, Gap Statistic, Silhouette scores, hierachael dendrogram clustering). 

k-means clustering is then performed when k has been assigned in the clustermeans variable (based on interepreting the figures generated by the above point). 

If bodymap data also present then matlab is called upon to generate a heatmap (compatible with AEQ MK3+ only). Image processing toolbox in MATLAB required and directories must be amended to reflect the user workspace.
