# AEQ

R code to determine number of clusters that is optimal for k-means using a variety of approaches. 

k-means clustering is then performed when k has been amended in the clustermeans variable. 

If bodymap data also present then matlab is called upon to generate a heatmap (compatible with AEQ MK3+ only). Image processing toolbox in MATLAB required.
